        **What this chart shows**  
        Each dot represents a district, clustered using Machine Learning based on Aadhaar volume, operational stability, and compliance quality.

        **How to read the axes**  
        • **X-axis (Total Volume – Log Scale):** Left = low-activity districts, Right = high-activity districts  
        • **Y-axis (Health Index 0–100):** Bottom = unstable or non-compliant systems, Top = stable and reliable systems  

        **What the colors mean**  
        • 🔴 **Critical Risk:** High operational stress or poor compliance  
        • 🟡 **Moderate:** Functional but inconsistent performance  
        • 🟢 **Healthy:** High throughput with strong stability and compliance  

        **Why this matters**  
        • High activity does not automatically imply a healthy identity system  
        • Some large districts process massive volumes but fail to maintain biometric freshness  

        **Key insight**  
        • Most large districts perform better due to stronger infrastructure  
        • The most important signals are large districts below the trend — they have scale but are failing  
        • These are the highest-value targets for audits, compliance checks, and fraud monitoring

            This chart visualizes how Aadhaar enrolment and update transactions are distributed across 
            pincodes within a single district.

            **Key observations**  
            • A small number of pincodes handle a disproportionately high workload.  
            • The high Coefficient of Variation (CV = 0.96) indicates severe intra-district imbalance.

            **Why this happens**  
            • Urban and high-density pincodes attract more transactions due to accessibility and awareness.  
            • Peripheral areas face lower demand or limited service access.

            **Why this matters**  
            • Uneven workload creates service pressure in high-demand areas.  
            • Underutilized capacity persists elsewhere.

            **Recommended action**  
            • Reallocate staff and kits at the pincode level.  
            • Deploy mobile enrolment units in high-load zones.  
            • Monitor variance metrics to detect early stress.

            • Child enrolments show strong seasonality with sharp peaks around August–September.  
            • Adult enrolments remain consistently low with only minor month-to-month variation.

            **Why this happens**  
            • Child enrolments are driven by academic admission cycles and school calendars.  
            • Adult enrolments are need-based and less dependent on fixed timelines.

            **Why this matters**  
            • Seasonal dependence makes child enrolment vulnerable to short-term disruptions.  
            • Adult enrolments provide a stable baseline demand across the year.

            **Recommended action**

            • High migration and urban churn  
            • Geographic barriers and limited access to update centers  

            **Why this matters**
